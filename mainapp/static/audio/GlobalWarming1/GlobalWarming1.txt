with two point five million years the earth's climate has fluctuated slightly to ice ages to warmer periods but in the last century the planet's temperature his visit and usually asked about one point two two one point four degrees fahrenheit scientists believe it's humidtoday it's driving the temperatures process known as global warming ever since the industrial revolution began factories power plants and eventually cars can burn fossil fuels such as oil and coal really seen huge amounts of carbon dioxide and other gases into the yamsthey're apt these greenhouse gases trapped him u. d. years to a naturally occurring process called greenhouse effect the greenhouse effect begins with the sun and andy energy radiates to the air it it's the air and the atmosphere absorb some of his energy and while the rest is read it back into spacethe naturally occurring gases in the atmosphere tracked some of his energy and reflected that morning here at the scientists now believe that the greenhouse effect is being intensified fighting at big house passes a few minutes and release it evidence for global warming includes a recent string of very warmly yoursscientists before the nineteen ninety eight was the warmest year in measured history with two thousand five hundred and set and meanwhile means taken from high school or show that the greenhouse gases carbon dioxide and methane and hit their highest levels in the past four hundred and twenty thousand years of ittake the ice is also shrinking according to nasa studies the extent that arctic sea ice has declined about ten percent in the last thirty years as long as industrialized nations consuming energy and developing countries increase their fossil fuel consumption the concentration of greenhouse gases in mehemisphere will continue to rise researchers predict that temperatures will increase about two to ten degrees fahrenheit by the end of the century was less an is what rising temperatures mean for the planet some climate models predict some changes others forecast rising sea levels which could likesolaris around the world whether patterns could change making hurricanes more frequent severe droughts could become more common in one area is an species unable to adapt to changing conditions of face extinction f. although much remains to be learned about global warmingmany organizations advocate cuttings greenhouse gas emissions to reduce the impact of global warming up of consumers can help by feeding energy around the house passed into that fluorescent light bulbs and friday for miles to the current fleet of a thief simple changes are made from your whereinhe had of hop
