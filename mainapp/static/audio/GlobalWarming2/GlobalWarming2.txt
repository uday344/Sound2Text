you may have heard of global climate change which is often called global warming but how much do we give the people understand the science of climate change take a moment to try takes place yourself how virtuallyall climate scientists think that earth is warming what is the physical or chemical mechanism in one steady we asked almost three hundred adults in the u. s. and not a single person could add to really explain the mechanism of global warming at a pretty basic levelallow west to give you a short explanation of how global warming works first here without earth's temperature works with al to say during how humans influence it the earth absorbs light from the senate which is mostly visible light to release that like an edgyearth also emits light but because the earth is colder than the senate to midst lower energy infra red light so earth earth is essentially transforms most of the visible light it gets from the sun in to him for red light green house gases in the atmosphere such as naftain and carbon x. sad when visible light passed through but absorb infrared light causing the atmosphere to retain heat this energy can be absorbed anybody by the atmosphere of many times before eventually returns to outer space the addedtime this energy hangs around his helped keep birth warm enough to support life as we know it without this greenhouse effect caused by these greenhouse gases in the atmosphere in the earth's average surface temperature would be about fifty degrees fahrenheit cooler which is well below the freezingwhite for ice so how have humans change things since the dawn of the industrial age around the years seventeen fifty atmosphere a carbon dioxide has increased by forty percent and methane has almost tripled these increases cause extrain for red light absorption meaning in extra greenhouse effect which is caused birth to seek a boat it's typical temperature range in other words energy that gets to earth has an even harder time leaving it's causing earth's average temperature to increase less producing global crimechange please hear this video with others and you can help them understand how global warming works too
